                        Self-Care Skills: Individuals diagnosed with autism generally cannot become self-sufficient in
                        the field of self-care, and this makes them dependent on others for a lifetime. It is aimed that
                        the student can continue his life as a self-sufficient individual with the self-care skills
                        studies we will do.
                        </br></br>
                        Life Skills: Life skills studies will also make the student independent in parallel with their
                        self-care skills, and beyond that, will help them communicate, develop the feelings of
                        cooperation and cooperation and make them compatible with common life.
                        </br></br>
                        Social Communication Studies: Autism is a social communication problem. The social rules and
                        communication processes that we improvise are a lesson that should be taught to individuals with
                        autism. In this context, all communication ways necessary in social life will be tried to be
                        taught in order.
                        </br></br>
                        Basic Sports Skills: There are some basic skills that human beings have at the most fundamental
                        level. These skills, such as walking, running, throwing, holding, jumping, leaping, develop
                        through play, activities, and social processes in their natural growth stages. Since individuals
                        with autism are often deprived of these processes, they have problems with these simplest
                        skills. However, these skills are a prerequisite for many complex skills in life.
                        </br></br>
                        Coordination Studies: Coordination is the ability to do more than one skill in a certain order
                        and timing. It includes many cognitive processes such as thinking, keeping in mind, estimating,
                        timing and reasoning. It also supports the ability to act without command.
                        </br></br>
                        Bicycle: Bicycle is an enjoyable vehicle that adorns every child's dreams. Unfortunately, most
                        of our children cannot ride bikes at all, they grow up without the necessary environment and
                        self-confidence. Almost all of Anka's students ride bicycles. Cycling is a joy of life for a
                        child, as it provides benefits in attention, concentration, awareness of body and space,
                        coordination and reasoning.
                        </br></br>
                        Table Tennis: Table tennis is an important study topic that we definitely work with each of our
                        students. It has positive contributions in many areas such as attention, eye tracking and eye
                        contact, hand eye coordination, space and body awareness, reasoning, and perception processes.
                        </br></br>
                        Fitness Workout: Fitness work , which is an important work to improve general body coordination
                        and body awareness, is also an important precaution against spinal problems that may occur in
                        later ages. Protecting from such problems, which is important for each individual, is more
                        important for individuals with different development.
                        </br></br>
                        Swimming Practice: First of all, swimming is an activity that almost all of our students love.
                        Most of the time, our students are more open to communication and therefore learning while doing
                        the activities they love. Thanks to swimming, in addition to many physical benefits, there is a
                        positive effect on language development with learning breath control. In addition, there are
                        scientific studies that show that swimming exercises reduce problem behaviors.
                        </br></br>
                        Special Education Support Activities: The goals of the student's special education skills are
                        supported and implemented by teamwork with a special education specialist.
                        </br></br>
                        Socialization Studies: In this topic, which is closely related to social communication studies,
                        on the one hand, social communication is studied, on the other hand, it is aimed to keep the
                        student in the society, to perceive, learn and obey the social rules. Going out with the student
                        life leader, going out to places such as shopping malls, cinemas, theaters, special shows for
                        children is provided to see all the social expectations in these places.
